Unless clearly prohibited by law or Section 2 of this Article VI, the Corporation shall indemnify any person ("Indemnified Person") made, or threatened to be made, a party in any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, including any action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she (or his or her testator in intestate), whether before or after adoption of this Section, (a) is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or (b) in addition is serving or served, in any capacity, at the request of the Corporation, as a Director or officer of any other Corporation, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The indemnification shall be against all judgements, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement (provided the Corporation shall have consented to such settlement) and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs of investigation, incurred by an Indemnified Person with respect to any such threatened or actual action or proceeding, and any appeal thereof.

### Section 2. Prohibited Indemnification

The Corporation shall not indemnify any person if a judgement or other final adjudication adverse to the Indemnified Person (or to the person whose actions are the basis for the action or proceeding) establishes, or the Board of Directors in good faith determines, that such person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty or gross negligence and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled.

### Section 3. Advancement of Expenses

The Corporation shall, on request of any Indemnified Person who is or may be entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation, pay or promptly reimburse the Indemnified Person's reasonably incurred expenses in connection with a threatened or actual action or proceeding prior to its final disposition. However, no such advancement of expenses shall be made unless the Indemnified Person makes a binding, written commitment to repay the Corporation, with interest, for any amount advanced for which it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified under the law or Section 2 of this Article VII. An Indemnified Person shall cooperate in good faith with any request by the Corporation that common legal counsel be used by the parties to such action or proceeding who are similarly situated unless it would be inappropriate to do so because of actual or potential conflicts between the interests of the parties.

### Section 4. Indemnification of Others

Unless clearly prohibited by law or Section 2 of this Article VII, the Board of Directors may approve Corporation indemnification as set forth in Section 1of this Article VII or advancement of expenses as set forth in Section 3 of this Article VII, to a person (or the testator of intestate of a person) who is or was employed by the Corporation or who is or was a volunteer for the Corporation, and who is made, or threatened to be made, a party in any action or proceeding, by reason of the fact of such employment or volunteer activity, including action undertaken in connection with service at the request of the Corporation in any capacity for any other Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

### Section 5. Determination of Indemnification

Indemnification mandated by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction will be paid. After termination or disposition of any actual or threatened action or proceeding against an Indemnified Person, if indemnification has not been ordered by a court, the Board of Directors shall, upon written request by the Indemnified Person, determine whether and to what extent indemnification is permitted pursuant to these Bylaws. Before indemnification can occur, the Board of Directors must find that such indemnification will not violate the provisions of Section 2 of this Article VI. No Director with a personal interest in the outcome, or who is a party to such actual or threatened action or proceeding concerning which indemnification is sought, shall participate in this determination. If a quorum of disinterested Directors is not obtainable, the Board of Directors shall act only after receiving the opinion in writing of independent legal counsel that indemnification is proper in the circumstances under then applicable law and these Bylaws.

### Section 6. Binding Effect

Any person entitled to indemnification under these Bylaws has a legally enforceable right to indemnification which cannot be abridged by amendment of these Bylaws with respect to any event, action or omission occurring prior to the date of such amendment.

### Section 7. Insurance

The Corporation is not required to purchase Directors' and officers' liability insurance, but the Corporation may purchase such insurance if authorized and approved by the Board of Directors. To the extent permitted by law, such insurance may insure the Corporation for any obligation it incurs as a result of this Article VI or operation of law and it may insure directly the Directors, officers, employees or volunteers of the Corporation for liabilities against which they are not entitled to indemnification under this Article VI as well as for liabilities against which they are entitled or permitted to be indemnified by the Corporation.

### Section 8. Nonexclusive Rights

The provisions of this Article VII shall not limit or exclude any other rights to which any person may be entitled under law or contract. The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into agreements on behalf of the Corporation with any Director, officer, employee or volunteer providing them rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with potential indemnification in addition to the provisions therefore in this Article VII, subject in all cases to the limitations of Section 2 of this Article VII.

Article VII - Compensation
--------------------------

### Section 1. Reasonable Compensation

It is the policy of the Corporation to pay no more than reasonable compensation for personal services rendered to the Corporation by officers and employees. The Directors of the Corporation shall not receive compensation for fulfilling their duties as Directors, although Directors may be reimbursed for actual out-of-pocket expenses which they incur in order to fulfill their duties as Directors. Expenses of spouses will not be reimbursed by the Corporation unless the expenses are necessary to achieve a Corporation purpose.

### Section 2. Approval of Compensation

The Board of Directors must approve in advance the amount of all compensation for all officers of the Corporation.

Before approving the compensation of an officer, the Board shall determine that the total compensation to be provided by the Corporation to the officers is reasonable in amount in light of the position, responsibility and qualification of the officer for the position held, including the result of an evaluation of the officer's prior performance for the Corporation, if applicable. In making the determination, the Board shall consider total compensation to include the salary and the value of all benefits provided by the Corporation to the individual in payment for services. At the time of the discussion and decision concerning an officer's compensation, the officers should not be present in the meeting. The Board shall obtain and consider appropriate data concerning comparable compensation paid to similar officers in like circumstances.

The Board shall set forth the basis for its decisions with respect to compensation in the minutes of the meeting at which the decisions are made, including the conclusions of this evaluation and the basis for determining that the individual's compensation was reasonable in light of the evaluation and the comparability data.
